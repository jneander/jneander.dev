## Story

I was part of the original team for AXUS Travel App, a travel itinerary curation service. A
web-based service, it allows travel agents and travelers to collaboratively curate itineraries. It
integrates with a wide variety of third-party services to automatically aggregate and simplify
travel details in a single interface. It is themeable, so different travel agencies can apply their
own branding and publish their own travel app on mobile app stores.

It started as a Clojure-based web application with a ClojureScript front end. It integrated with
booking databases used by the travel industry. Additionally, it provided a way for users to email
completed bookings and have them parsed and incorporated into their itineraries automatically.

The web service grew to include a private API, and later a public API. The private API is consumed
by companion iOS and Android applications. Multiple members of my team participated in the
development of the service over several years. As the number of contributors increased, increased
emphasis was placed on ease of maintenance and extension for current and future team members.

On later engagements, I helped with the Android app to maintain feature parity with the iOS version.
The underlying web service was refactored to be more extensible and support a growing number of use
cases and integrations. The ClojureScript front end was converted to JavaScript.
