## Story

The client had a large sales team that connected with businesses on an individual basis, meaning
individual salespeople talked with individual businesses. Businesses would enter the system as
leads. Next, a member of the sales team would manually follow a defined set of rules to assign each
lead to the appropriate salesperson.

This process did not scale, so our team was tasked with automating it. I paired with Dariusz Pasciak
to encapsulate the process in a Ruby script, implementing a rule system that applied the existing
process. It integrated with the sales system to utilize internal data about the leads and team
members.

We iteratively refined and extended the rules, regularly demonstrating development progress and
discussing the agenda in planning meetings with the client.

By delivering this tool, the sales team was able to efficiently assign leads and better utilize the
time otherwise spent on the manual process.
