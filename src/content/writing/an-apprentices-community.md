If there is anything which life as a student has taught me, it is how to learn. Prior to my start as
an apprentice, I could not imagine the incredible community of developers into which I was about to
enter. Indeed, living the country life and learning on my own was an exercise in "doing it wrong."

The journey I have taken from then until now, upon reflection, aligns well with a few "patterns"
from the book [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do) by
[Dave Hoover](http://redsquirrel.com/dave/) and [Ade Oshineye](http://blog.oshineye.com/). It is a
wonderful resource for the perpetual student and comes highly recommended for those either seeking
or already in an apprenticeship in software development.

## Find Mentors

When I made the switch to software development as a career goal, I was a few years out of college
with not much computer science experience. School will only carry a person so far; I needed
something more. To quote the problem from Dave and Ade's book, "You're walking along a path with no
idea of what's around the next corner or how to prepare for it. You need help and guidance."

In an effort to find my way forward, I sought the advice and experience of my college instructors.
My two greatest supporters, [Adrian Herbez](http://www.adrianherbez.net/) and
[Pamela Dunn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/pamdunn), were more than willing to help me discover my
path. While I would not consider them my mentors, nor myself their apprentice, they gave of their
time and knowledge as a true mentor would. We found some gaps in my own experience and worked to
fill them in.

The next step in my journey comes from both their sage advice and another pattern from the book.

## Kindred Spirits

As the pattern describes, "You find yourself stranded without mentors and in an atmosphere that
seems at odds with your aspirations." While I had the support of my instructors, I did not truly
have a mentor. What I did have was an environment, far from the city and almost completely devoid of
fellow developers. I needed a community.

I was encouraged to network, to seek connections with others in my chosen profession. I researched a
few meet-ups in Chicago which seemed interesting, then made the voyage to the first of many. Timid,
yet motivated, I introduced myself and joined in conversation. On this very first evening, I learned
some important things which helped me to find direction. The most notable of these was that there is
such a thing as an apprenticeship in software development. Until this time, I had never heard of
such a thing.

At this meet-up, I realized much more than what my next goal would be. I also learned the steps I
would need to take to reach that goal. New and important ideas, such as test-driven development and
"clean code," would prove crucial to my own preparation for an apprenticeship. Not long thereafter,
following many more conversations with developers of all experience levels, I was accepted as an
apprentice at 8th Light under the guidance of
[Colin Jones](https://8thlight.com/authors/colin-jones).

This community has led me to many wonderful opportunities. Still, one of the greatest lessons to
learn was soon to come.

## Unleash Your Enthusiasm

"You have an insatiable excitement and curiosity regarding the craft of software development. You
find yourself holding back..." Dave and Ade describe the "holding back" as a result of being
"conscious of how much more enthusiasm you have for the work than your colleagues do." My own
enthusiasm was withheld for a slightly different reason: I was still apprehensive around more
talented and experienced developers than myself. More to the point, I was intimidated.

In the midst of my apprenticeship, I was invited to attend the StrangeLoop conference in St. Louis.
Uncertain of whether I could make the most of the experience, I was quite simply advised to "just
take it in." By the end of the first day, being surrounded by experienced professionals and
respected leaders in the field had me completely overwhelmed. I was at a loss for some perspective.
At dinner that evening, one of our craftsman exclaimed, "I love being in a room surrounded by people
so much smarter than me." It took a moment or two to digest, but I realized the wisdom in these
words.

In the time since, I have been less apprehensive and instead more engaged on occasions such as this.
Being around this wealth of knowledge and experience is not something to fear, but something to
embrace. When the next conference came along, this time 8th Light's own SCNA, my enthusiasm was not
hidden away. I networked with attendees and speakers alike, unafraid to learn something new or make
a lasting connection. Much like my very first meet-up, I discovered opportunities for personal
growth which I otherwise would have missed.

The greatest resource you have as a learner is your community. Avail yourself of the guidance and
support which no book nor tutorial can offer. Attend meetups. Participate in discussions. Kindly ask
for advice and feedback. Seek others willing to sit down with you and help you along, and treat them
to coffee. If you humble yourself and reveal your willingness to learn, knowledge and growth will
soon follow.

Your own path of learning may take a completely different course from mine. Your goals and
aspirations might be entirely your own. Regardless of your chosen path, always remember that there
is a vast collective of beginners and masters and everything in-between. Everyone has something to
teach; everyone has something to learn.
