## Description

Instructure is a company that develops educational software, with a focus on providing a
comprehensive learning ecosystem. Their SaaS products support educators and learners across K–12,
higher education, and professional environments. In addition to the flagship product Canvas LMS,
they provide other products that complement Canvas, such as tools for assessment and data analysis.

Canvas LMS is the world’s #1 teaching and learning software. Used by more than 6500 organizations
(over 36% of higher education institutions), it has reached more than 30 million students. It is an
open-source Ruby on Rails application with a mixed front end (mostly React), backed by PostgreSQL.
It is built to scale; the architecture is robust, able to handle spikes in usage and support more
than 6 million concurrent users.

I worked on the Gradebook team, responsible for features including student assessment and
instructor-student communication. Our most substantial team effort was a years-long overhaul of the
Gradebook, maturing it into a robust course grading environment. In collaboration with the Canvas
community, it was initially available as a private beta, then a public beta. With continuous
feedback, it eventually became the default experience that instructors use to this day.

This chapter of my career was as challenging as it was rewarding, teaching and nourishing skills in
leadership, collaboration, and project management as a part of a fantastic team. I cherish this time
in my life, the memories as much as the experience.

## My Role

I was a full-stack engineer, responsible for front-end features and tooling as well as server-side
development and data modeling. I was responsible for planning and delivering feature work, leading
specific milestones, reviewing code, informal mentorship of interns and junior engineers, writing
tests, and contributing to our shared UI library. I also worked on the front end build.
