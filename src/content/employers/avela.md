## Description

Avela is a company on a mission to create a more equitable enrollment process for educational
institutions. Their software helps streamline the admissions process, particularly focusing on
simplifying it and making it more accessible to underserved students. Avela's platform aims to
ensure all qualified applicants have a fair shot at admission by addressing biases and complexities
that can hinder equal opportunity.

The Avela Enroll Suite covers all stages of the enrollment journey. The “Apply” app streamlines the
application process for parents and provides a workflow manager for admins. The “Match” service
facilitates student assignment and admission lotteries, leveraging Nobel Prize winning algorithms
for accuracy and equity. The “Explore” app is a robust school-finding service, helping families find
schools for their children.

I worked with a small team of people still navigating new terrain as a startup. My code
contributions centered around the “Apply” app, adding features for admins and restructuring the
parent experience. I worked closely with Celeste Saad, the top-notch Designer responsible for all of
Avela’s user experiences.

## My Role

All engineers were full-stack, in a flat hierarchy. We shared responsibilities for client-side,
server-side, and infrastructure contributions. That included all feature work and internal tooling.
The front end was built on React, using Chakra UI. The back end was a collection of
tightly-integrated AWS resources built using the AWS CDK. The communication layer was GraphQL,
facilitated by Apollo.
