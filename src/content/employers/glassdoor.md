## Description

Glassdoor is a company and a web service dedicated to helping job seekers and employers alike. It’s
marketed as “a thriving community for workplace conversations, driven by a simple mission: helping
people everywhere find jobs and companies they love.” More than that, it’s a safe space for people
to share their work experiences with others in their fields.

On the B2C side of the service, individuals can look for jobs and read anonymous reviews of
companies. Going further, they gain valuable insights into company culture, salaries, and interview
experience, all designed to empower job seekers to make informed career decisions. On the B2B side,
employers have a place to shape and share their stories, post jobs, and learn how their messaging
connects with people.

I started by working on the B2B side of Glassdoor, in the Employer Center. This was the primary tool
for employers to manage their brand and curate their presence on Glassdoor. I later joined the
newly-formed Front End Platform Team, responsible for all libraries, tools, and workflows used for
front end development across the organization. Most notably, I led the Design System overhaul that
enabled the company rebrand in 2023.

The projects I was able to work on and lead at Glassdoor were both exciting and challenging. I
worked with some incredibly skilled and simply delightful folks during my time here.

## My Role

I started on a feature team for the B2B side of Glassdoor. While technically full-stack, the bulk of
my contributions were user-facing. The client-side is React-based, with a custom UI Library built
for the internal design system. I transitioned to an internal platform team, responsible for all
developer tooling, including our UI Library. I was the lead engineer on the design system, working
with Design to plan and implement both the design system and its React implementation.
