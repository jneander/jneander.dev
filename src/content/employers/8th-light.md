## Description

8th Light is a consultancy founded on principles of humanity, education, and ownership. They work
with companies of all sizes, as well as startups, committing to meaningful, lasting client
relationships. Services include process consulting, staff augmentation, and in-studio development of
client projects.

The 8th Light apprenticeship program was central to developing the team. Everyone began as an
apprentice, being mentored while learning multiple languages, design principles, code quality, and
development processes. My apprenticeship under [Colin Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trptcolin/)
lasted five months, after which I graduated to full-time Craftsperson.

During my time there, we primarily used Ruby on Rails and Clojure. But our projects were not
restricted to those tools. I personally worked on projects with various technologies (Java, Qt,
Bluetooth) and wildly different natures (retail kiosk, automotive dashboard, smartcard). It wasn’t
just an entry into software development, it was like a world tour through tech.

I will forever appreciate the experience and relationships I had as a part of the 8th Light team.

## My Role

I joined team rotations for clients, working on projects in our studio and collaborating on-site
with their engineering teams. Some long-running projects had a regular rotation of 8th Light
crafters on and off every few months. There were almost always two of us, a primary and secondary
craft, working alongside each other and frequently pairing. In addition, I had a couple of solo
engagements for short-term projects, and also led project development from initial concept on
others.
