      <p>
        Led development on a dynamic touch interface for a home improvement products catalog which
        responded to user interaction by projecting product imagery onto the surfaces of a blank
        room. The product browser was a JavaScript web application hosted on a local Node.js server.
        A client-managed application synced product inventory data daily. The local server provided
        an API for an iOS companion app.

      <p>
        Collaborated closely with the UX Designers. Emphasis was given to making the Interface
        Designersâ€™ work as frictionless as possible. Succeeded with the challenge of using zero
        JavaScript dependencies in the product browser.
