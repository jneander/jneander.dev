        Led development on a dynamic touch interface for a home improvement products catalog which
        responded to user interaction by projecting product imagery onto the surfaces of a blank
        room. The product browser was a JavaScript web application hosted on a local Node.js server.
        A client-managed application synced product inventory data daily. The local server provided
        an API for an iOS companion app.

        Collaborated closely with the UX Designers. Emphasis was given to making the Interface
        Designersâ€™ work as frictionless as possible. Succeeded with the challenge of using zero
        JavaScript dependencies in the product browser.
