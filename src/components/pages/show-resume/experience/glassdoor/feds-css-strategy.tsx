        My work on the B2B Platform Team naturally extended into org-wide frontend concerns, as the
        technical debt I was addressing extended across the entire organization. A substantial
        hurdle for fellow frontend engineers—and by extension, all product development—was the
        near-incalculably large collection of legacy CSS. We needed tools to address this growing
        problem.

      <p>
        Additionally, we needed to select more appropriate tools for our organization, allowing us
        to more quickly and confidently deliver frontend features without having to fight our tools
        or reinvent the wheel. To start, I surveyed all frontend engineers for their experiences and
        preferences in relation to developing with CSS, both at Glassdoor and outside. Results were
        parsed, reported to the org, then used for a deeper dive into potential solutions.

      <p>
        Knowing our collective experience and preferences, the current state and constraints of our
        applications, and the near-future needs of the organization that would soon need to be
        realized, the research project continued into the assorted technologies used in the
        industry. This extended effort culminated in two proofs of concept, plus an exhaustive
        report and recommendation on the direction I believed the organization should take.
      </p>

      <p>
        After review by the team, including with the VP of Engineering, a consensus was reached. The
        research and its conclusion were subsequently presented to the organization, laying the
        conceptual groundwork for frontend engineers to follow.
