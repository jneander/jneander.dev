      <p>
        My experiences across past client work and side projects provided tools and methods for
        debugging, understanding, and improving tools used to build Canvas. Testing tools and
        practices were continually updated and adjusted to benefit the team and the organization. I
        diagnosed and resolved critical build issues and averted engineering downtime.
