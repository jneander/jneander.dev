        We extended business logic to accommodate needs of institutions using multiple levels of
        bucketing for grading. Grade calculations were retooled to work with new partitioning and
        weighting rules. Front and back end validations were implemented to ensure historical grades
        were no longer recalculated, both for performance and to prevent user shenanigans.
